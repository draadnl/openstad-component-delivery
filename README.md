# Openstad Component Delivery
Install with `npm i` and run `npm run dev`. Server is then accessible through http://localhost:3030.

## Loading a component
You can load the PoC component like this: (see `test.html` for an example):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost:3030/component/37fa0ed70b41c1266fbc0788a15b8816"></script>
```

The component will be placed exactly where the `<script>` tag is placed.
